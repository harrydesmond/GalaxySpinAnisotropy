# GalaxySpinAnisotropy

Code for reproducing the results of Patel & Desmond 2024 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06617), assessing the significance of dipoles in galaxy spin directions. Both a frequentist and Bayesian code is provided. Also included is a code mock_data_validation.py which checks that the inference is unbiased on mock data with known injected monopole and dipole. See comments in the codes for further instructions.

Please contact Harry Desmond (harry.desmond@port.ac.uk) with feedback or questions.
