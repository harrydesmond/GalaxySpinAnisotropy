# Galaxy Spin Anisotropy

Code for reproducing the results of Patel & Desmond 2024 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06617), assessing the significance of dipoles in galaxy spin directions. Both frequentist and Bayesian codes are provided. Also included is a code mock_data_validation.py which checks that the inference is unbiased on mock data with known injected monopole and dipole. See the comments at the start of the codes for further instructions.

Contact Harry Desmond (harry.desmond@port.ac.uk) and Dhruva Patel (zx970439@ou.ac.uk) with feedback or questions.
